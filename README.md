Cas-BreNet
A cascade breast automated diagnostic network (Cas-BreNet), that leverages dynamic contrast-enhanced phase I magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-P1-MRI) to achieve rapid and accurate diagnosis of breast lesion categories. Our model Cas-BreNet is developed based on nnUnet, and the comparison model code is placed in the benchmark folder. The model run is executed by installing the libraries required by nnUnet.
